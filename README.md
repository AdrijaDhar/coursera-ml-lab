Hello there !
   I am sorry to bother you.
   
   I am taking the Machine Learning Specialization course on Coursera in audit mode, because I do not have the money to pay for the full version of the course. So I only have access to the video courses, and I unfortunately do not have access to the labs. This github repo is a very great help, but since it's all answered, I cannot learn much from it. Do you by any chance have the labs without answers so that I can try them out ? I would be forever grateful for you if you could send them to me somehow; here's my email : ji_bachiri@esi.dz
   I couldn't figure out how to ask you this question so I'm sending you a pull request, sorry !
  
Thank you so much in advance !
